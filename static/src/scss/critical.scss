// Animations are not included here, but only in the main-file. If you need keyframe animations for your critical components,
// you should include the file here as well. Please note that a certain amount of "tree shaking" is applied to the minified
// files, so if you only include animations in one file and not the other, and certain keyframes are not referenced in either
// "code-set", you may get a nasty surprise once you start using it in production-mode and nothing animates at all.
//
// Bottom line: if you use animations in your critical components, you must ensure the keyframes are included here.


// Layout settings. These are not included in "main" by default.
