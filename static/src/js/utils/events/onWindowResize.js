/**
 * Responsive window handler to detect **window resizing**, **orientation changes** and **active breakpoints**.
 *
 * This module exposes a set of tools to detect when the window has been resized or the orientation has
 * changed. It also figures out which breakpoint is currently active, and provides a set of tools to compare
 * breakpoint sizes programmatically.
 *
 * All callbacks are throttled to avoid using too many CPU cycles.
 *
 * Breakpoints are imported from `src/site-settings.json` automatically. Please remember to add them in order.
